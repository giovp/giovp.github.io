I am a PhD student in [Fabian Theis' group][1], at the [Computational Health Center, Helmholtz Munich, Germany][2]
and the [Munich School for Data Science][3]. I am also co-founder and core developer of [scverse][4].

I am interested in **Machine Learning** and **Software** for **Spatial Biology**.

I am the co-lead developer of the following open-source Python packages:
- [Moscot](https://moscot.readthedocs.io/): tools for Optimal Transport applications in Single Cell Genomics.
- [SpatialData](https://spatialdata.scverse.org/en/latest/): a data format and ecosystem for Spatial Omics Data, part of scverse.
- [Squidpy](https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/): tools for the analysis of Spatial Transcriptomics data, part of scverse.
